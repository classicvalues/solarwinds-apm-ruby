## Getting started
The gem instruments the ruby language and ruby on rails frameworks. It is hosted on RubyGems, making installation as 
simple as: `gem install solarwinds_apm`.

Our ruby extension gets detailed insights out-of-the-box without any code modification. 
For a list of instrumented gems and components see https://docs.appoptics.com/kb/apm_tracing/ruby/support-matrix

Detailled installation instructions for Ruby and different frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, and Grape can be 
found here https://docs.appoptics.com/kb/apm_tracing/ruby/install

## Custom instrumentation
If you have code or a library that is not on the platform support list, use our SDK (as documented here) to customize.
