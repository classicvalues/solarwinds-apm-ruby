# oboe 1.3.0

* The oboe and oboe_fu gems have been merged to simplify installation. The
final oboe_fu gem (1.3.0) simply calls "require 'oboe'" now for backwards
compatibility.
* Please note our updated installation instructions for the new location of
Ruby oboe API methods.
* Our gem now successfully installs even if your platform does not have our
base packages (liboboe) installed, so you can deploy to environments with or
without AppOptics support.

# oboe_fu 1.2.1

* Support for instrumenting the dalli module.

# oboe_fu 1.2.0

* Support for Rails 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.
