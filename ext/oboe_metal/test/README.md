C-code tests:

CMakeLists.txt includes downloading and compiling googletest if necessary

In the ext/oboe_metal/test directory:

Set an environment variable for the current path:
```
export TEST_DIR=`pwd`
```

Every time the ruby version changes the solarwinds_apm gem needs to be 
re-installed or its c++-code recompiled and relinked

These environment variables need to be set every time the ruby version is set:
```
export RUBY_INC_DIR=$(ruby ruby_inc_dir.rb)
export RUBY_PREFIX=$(ruby ruby_prefix.rb)
```

create the Makefile (needs to be remade when the ruby version changes)
```
cmake -S . -B build
```
build
```
cmake --build build
```
run 
```
cd build && ctest && cd -
```

Most testing of profiling is done via Ruby integration tests

For example logging is tested in Ruby tests that verify the different
KVs and values in the resulting traces, using the same approach as 
for traces without profiling.

Gotchas:
 
- In alpine the `ruby/config.h` file is in an architecture specific folder and needs 
  to be symlinked to the location set via RUBY_INC_DIR (see: Dockerfile_alpine)
  
TODO:

- write a script for this

```
export TEST_DIR=`pwd`
export RUBY_INC_DIR=$(ruby ruby_inc_dir.rb)
export RUBY_PREFIX=$(ruby ruby_prefix.rb)
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cd build && ctest && cd -
```
